# work-queue

Interface for deferred execution; implementations are platform specific.

Part of [hwlib](https://github.com/integra-lib) — architecture-independent C++20
components shared between firmware projects. Header-only,
no exceptions, no RTTI.

## Use it

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:integra-lib/work-queue.git external/hwlib/work-queue
```

```cmake
add_subdirectory(external/hwlib/work-queue)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE Hwlib::work_queue)
```

```cpp
#include <hwlib/execution/work_queue.hpp>
```

Each component carries its own include directory, so this header stays unreachable
until the component is linked: a forgotten dependency is a compile error rather than
a build that happens to work.

## Versioning

Every component is released on its own, tagged `vX.Y.Z`. Pre-1.0, a minor release may
break the API, which is why dependants accept a single minor.

```bash
git -C external/hwlib/work-queue fetch --tags
git -C external/hwlib/work-queue checkout v0.2.0
git add external/hwlib/work-queue && git commit -m "build: bump work-queue to v0.2.0"
```

## In a consumer's CI

The component is an ordinary submodule, so the build needs it checked out. On GitLab
that means `GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: normal` (or `recursive`) on every job that builds —
not only on the ones that run unit tests.

## Develop it

```bash
git submodule update --init          # ci-shared, needed by pre-commit
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j && ctest --test-dir build
```

Tests are built only when this repository is the top-level project, so a consumer
never builds them and never fetches GoogleTest.

The style configs are symlinks into the `ci-shared` submodule, and the pipeline comes
from the same place. On GitHub this repository carries a self-contained build-and-test
workflow instead: a workflow token cannot read another private repository, so neither
a shared workflow nor the submodule is reachable there. The shared setup is what
GitLab will use.
